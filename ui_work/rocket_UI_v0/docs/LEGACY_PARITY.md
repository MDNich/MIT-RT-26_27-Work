# Legacy UI feature parity — September 20, 2026

The previous `ground_station/UI.py`, `rocket.py`, and `pointer.py` are the behavioral reference. Existing source, images and planning documents are reference material; the user's instruction to retain all old functionality takes precedence over the earlier revamp's proposed restrictions. The original files are unchanged.

## Feature inventory

| Original function | Current location / behavior |
|---|---|
| Two serial selectors, Refresh, Connect, Disconnect | Persistent ground and pointer connection cards; separate workers, 115200 8N1, original DTR/RTS defaults and read timeouts |
| Start/Stop Polling | Persistent header and original shortcut; connecting alone does not start polling; commands remain available with polling stopped |
| Start/Stop Logging | Persistent header and original shortcut; immediate start into a unique app-data session folder |
| Good and rejected telemetry CSVs | `telemetry.csv` and `telemetry_badpackets.csv`, all 43 original columns, alongside raw/SQLite/video recording |
| State, RSSIs, packet age, filtered/max altitude, roll, velocity, angle from vertical, temperature | Rocket controls → Telemetry; packet number additionally displayed |
| Rocket GPS fix, latitude/longitude, altitude/max altitude, horizontal/vertical precision, satellites | Rocket controls → Telemetry, all original precision retained |
| Four servo drives and degree conversions | Rocket controls → Telemetry; also available in GNC/actuators |
| Three cell voltages, thresholds/color cues | Rocket controls → Telemetry |
| Six power rail requests/readbacks, total current, power temperature | Rocket controls → Power; 3.3 V request remains fixed on, Total remains read-only aggregate |
| BMS enabled/triggered status | Rocket controls → Power; all eight bits are visible |
| State advance, zero P/Y/Roll, altitude, velocity, servos, PD Activate | Rocket controls → Rocket commands |
| Roll and airbrake servo angle entry/send | Rocket controls → Rocket commands; same float32 wire values |
| VTX power 1/3/5/8 W | Rocket controls → Rocket commands |
| Six pyro selections, continuity, arm/fire readbacks, resistance | Rocket controls → Recovery & pyros |
| ARM/FIRE selected pyros | Same channel mask and original confirmation/no-selection behavior |
| Piston, BP wells, tender descender, all recovery | Same four commands and individual confirmation dialogs |
| Manual antenna elevation/azimuth | Antenna pointer → Send; finite numerical entries sent directly, with no added calibration or envelope prerequisites |
| Pointer UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/ZERO | Original opcodes 1/2/3/4/5; enabled by the pointer connection independently of the ground board |
| Ground GPS display and freeze | Antenna pointer → Send to AntPtr / Unfreeze GPS |
| Live rocket tracking | Both boards plus polling, frozen ground coordinates, and valid rocket position; original 5 Hz coordinate calculation |
| Current local date/time and status | Persistent status bar, connection panel and Diagnostics |
| Every keyboard shortcut | Serial controls menu; works across all eight workspaces |

## Exact shortcuts

Qt uses the same `QKeySequence` strings as the original PyQt5 UI. On macOS these render and operate with Command for Ctrl and Option for Alt.

- `Ctrl+R`: refresh both port lists.
- `Ctrl+Alt+C`: toggle ground connection.
- `Shift+Ctrl+Alt+C`: toggle pointer connection.
- `Ctrl+Return`: toggle polling.
- `Ctrl+L`: toggle logging.
- `Ctrl+Up`, `Ctrl+Down`, `Ctrl+Right`, `Ctrl+Left`: native pointer direction commands.
- `Ctrl+0`: native pointer zero.

Actions are bound once, so repeated status refreshes cannot duplicate transmissions or connection toggles.

## Reference-based verification

`tests/fixtures/legacy_reference.json` captures outputs from the actual original class methods: 118 rocket packets covering all 18 opcodes plus the zero-roll alias, all 64 converter masks, each pyro channel and grouped masks, all VTX choices, state advances, and several signed servo angles; eight pointer packet cases; three geographic tracking cases; every CSV column; and the ten shortcut strings read from the original UI. The fixture records SHA-256 hashes of all three reference files.

`scripts/capture_legacy_reference.py /path/to/ground_station` can regenerate the fixture. It evaluates class definitions with physical connection methods removed and substitutes in-memory byte streams. It never opens a serial device. Tests run without requiring the reference source folder.

Regression coverage checks the captured bytes and decoded values, actual Qt keyboard event dispatch across views, two OS pseudo-terminals, separate polling, independent board enablement, ground-GPS freeze/calculation, one-click logging, confirmation acceptance/rejection, disconnect/reconnect, CSV/raw recordings and rejected-packet isolation. All physical I/O in these tests terminates at virtual devices.

## Preserved conventions and bug fixes

- Tracking preserves the old frozen receiver latitude/longitude rounded to five decimals, pointer altitude fixed to zero, and rocket filtered barometric altitude. Mission trajectory datum settings do not change these legacy pointing commands.
- Receiver altitude display/CSV preserves the old signed-int32 read and division by 1000, despite the audited receiver firmware's unit discrepancy. Ground fix means trailer value 3.
- Good-packet CSV retains the original two unused zeros in armed/fired/resistance lists, and original servo degree rounding. Lists use ordinary Python numeric/boolean representations, readable without NumPy wrappers.
- Bad-packet CSV uses the same field interpretation as good packets. This fixes two old bad-packet-only inconsistencies: swapped maximum-altitude fields and a different ground-fix test. The `badpackets` column now counts rejected packets; the old counter remained at zero. Rejected packets remain isolated from live displays and replay samples.
- BMS status has eight columns rather than the old six-column allocation with eight labels. Cell voltages and pyro states retain distinct status colors.
- Logging no longer depends on launching from a particular working directory. The original schema is preserved inside the portable app's unique session directory.
- Old duplicate QAction signal connections are fixed; supported actions and key combinations are unchanged.

The full UI and wire behaviors are regression-tested. Physical board, camera and mount testing remains a separate hardware acceptance step. The new simulation/video/trajectory features remain additive. Windows packaging is deferred for this revision at the user's request.
