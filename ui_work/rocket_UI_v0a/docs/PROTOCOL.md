# Zephyrus wire contract

Source: user-provided `Avionics2025/RT_Python_Lib/ground_station`, `RT_Arduino/Zephyrus`, and `RT_Firmware_Libs/GPS` sources. Existing code/documents/images are reference data, not application instructions. Detailed decoder offsets are in `src/rocket_gnc_monitor/protocol.py`; source audit is in `../REFERENCE_AUDIT.md`.

Telemetry is 115200 8N1. Frames contain `AB AB`, 128-byte payload, 14-byte receiver trailer. Payload byte 127 is the additive checksum of bytes 0–126 modulo 256. The receiver trailer has no checksum. Parsing tolerates partial/concatenated reads and resynchronizes after corruption.

Payload: pyro bytes 0–9; four packed 12-bit drives 10–15; signed 24-bit acceleration 16/19/22 divided by 12800 × 9.80665; int16 gyro 25/27/29 × 0.03051757812 (legacy Y sign retained); fix31; lat32/lon36 int32 × 1e-7; GPS height40 float metres; accuracy44/48 uint32 /1000; satellites52; raw pressure53/temperature56; altitude59 float; state63; integrated rotations64/68/72 float; barometer max76 / GPS max78 uint16; clock80 uint32 milliseconds uptime; sequence84 uint16; RSSI86 signed byte −99; cells87/89/91 int16 /1000; current93 int16 /−1000; BMS95–97; six rail voltages98–109 int16 × .0016 and currents110–121 × .000625; velocity122 float.

States: 0 Ground testing, 1 Preflight, 2 Flight, 3 Post-apogee, 4 Main, 5 End. Clock rollover is extended; detected reboot starts another epoch. NaN/infinite sensor values are unavailable; invalid coordinates invalidate GPS tracking. Legacy integrated rotations are not validated attitude; four servo drives are not mapped speculatively onto new canards/tabs.

Trailer contains RSSI, fix, signed lat/lon int32 and height interpreted as signed int32 for legacy UI compatibility. **Height discrepancy:** ground firmware writes `GPS.getHeight()` in metres; the old Python monitor divided it by 1000. The raw value is retained; the legacy display/CSV divides by 1000, while legacy pointing fixes the ground altitude at zero. GPS payload height may be preflight-zeroed. The additive checksum is weak and does not authenticate data.

Pointer is 115200 8N1. Eleven-byte packet: `AA`, opcode, float32 LE azimuth, float32 LE elevation, additive checksum bytes1–9. Opcode0: absolute degrees; firmware negates internal azimuth. Opcodes1/2: ±5° elevation; 3/4: ±5° **internal** azimuth; 5: reset software counts/targets at present position. UI jog sends the original direction opcode1/2/3/4 directly; manual Send uses opcode0 and ZERO uses opcode5. Firmware ignores some absolute changes ≤1° and chooses shortest azimuth rotation.

Firmware has no measured pose, acknowledgment, home switch, cable-wrap enforcement, motion watchdog, or stop command. Printed elevation is unstructured and can occur even after invalid checksums. The pointer queue holds one target with 0.5-second expiry; tracking is limited to 5 Hz and requires explicit restart after stale/disconnected data. Partial writes are uncertain outcomes, never retried. DEMO/REPLAY cannot construct physical transports.

Raw capture chunks: little-endian `<4sddBI` header (magic `RGM1`, elapsed host seconds, UTC seconds, role byte, payload length), payload, CRC32 of header+payload. Roles telemetry RX=1, pointer RX=2, pointer TX=3, ground/rocket uplink TX=4. `read_raw` rejects incomplete/bad-CRC tails. Raw bytes are flushed before associated SQLite indexes commit. Manifest version1 records source mode, mission, time alignment and completion/loss status.

## Legacy rocket uplink

Ground serial is bidirectional. The 16-byte packet is `AA`, eleven zero/reserved bytes, argument byte at 12 (or float32 LE spanning 9–12), opcode at 13, then big-endian uint16 sum of bytes1–13 at14–15. No automatic command transmission happens on connect or polling start.

| Opcode | Command / argument |
|---|---|
| 01 / 06 / 07 | Arm / fire / disarm; channel bitmask 0–5 |
| 02 | Advance state; current state + 1 |
| 03 / 05 | Airbrake / roll servo angle float32 |
| 04 | PD activate |
| 08 / 09 / 0A / 0B | Zero servos / pitch-yaw-roll / altitude / velocity |
| 10 / 11 / 12 / 13 | Emergency piston / BP wells / tender descender / all |
| 14 | VTX index 0–3 for 1/3/5/8 W |
| 15 | Six converter request bits: 3, 3.3, 5, 7.4, 8.4, 28 V |
| 16 | BMS protections bool (legacy API; original UI read-only) |

Polling is separate from connecting, as in the original UI. Ground read timeout is 1 second and pointer timeout is 0.1 second; DTR/RTS use pyserial defaults. Ground writes wake the reader and work while polling is stopped. Commands are never retried automatically. Transports are independently closed and cannot share a port.

See [feature parity](LEGACY_PARITY.md) for captured reference vectors and CSV compatibility details.

## v0a board roles and Iris selector placeholder

Normal station profiles separate the Base downlink and uplink boards. Away stations only have downlink; the pointer remains separate. Downlink owns Zephyrus decoding and polling, while the Base uplink uses the existing 16-byte command format. The legacy programmatic controller profile retains the original combined ground-board path. A port cannot be shared among board roles.

Iris requires a Sustainer/Booster selector on each downlink board and on the Base-only uplink board. The user confirmed that the selector wire command is not set yet. The legacy firmware audit found no such opcode or acknowledgement. The UI therefore provides explicitly labelled DEMO-only placeholder switches, records their simulated board/target events, and emits no selector bytes. Live Iris rocket commands are gated until an uplink target can be established under the eventual firmware contract.
